## Command Line Tools

This repository contains my attempts to create command line utilities that streamline my daily tasks.

### Tools

- [**`lowercase`**](./lowercase): Simple and lightweight CLI tool to fight my OCD and convert filenames to lowercase.
- [**`rmcache`**](./rmcache): A very simple but powerful tool to delete cache files and directories.
- [**`run`**](./run): A commmand line tool helps you run a file with a specific command.

Tools are written in different languages, including `Go`, `Rust`, `Bash`, `Fish`, etc.
